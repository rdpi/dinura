That was extremely terrifying. I've never been that close to a bear or any kind of predatory animal like that,\" McKenzie said.\n\n\"All I could see was blood pouring down on my shirt and my body and my legs.\"\n\nHer dogs weren't injured. \n\n![hit-by-bear](http://localhost:1337/uploads/hit_by_bear_32454849f7.jpeg)\n##### McKenzie says she's hiked with her dogs numerous times all over Canada and the U.S., including a backpacking trip along the Colorado Trail. (Submitted by Erin McKenzie)\n\nMcKenzie has hiked and backpacked thousands of kilometres in her life and has seen a lot of wildlife, but she says she got complacent.\n\n\"Just be aware of your surroundings and don't get too comfortable. I think that's part of the problem, is you get relaxed hiking â€¦ and running so often out there without ever having an incident,\" she said.\n\n## How to be bear safe\n\nDuhard offers a similar caution.\n\n\"Riding Mountain National Park is home to many black bears, and visitors can encounter a bear at any time or any place, whether it be on a busy trail close to town or in the remote backcountry,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Bears generally prefer to avoid people. However, encounters between bears and people do occur.\"\n","author":1,"headline":"Runner thankful to be alive after being swatted by bear in Riding Mountain National Park","created_at":"2020-07-16T02:28:52.105Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T02:55:34.080Z","featured":[{"id":3,"name":"hit-by-bear","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":780,"height":439,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"hash":"thumbnail_hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d","ext":".webp","mime":"image/webp","width":245,"height":138,"size":4.35,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d.webp"},"medium":{"hash":"medium_hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d","ext":".webp","mime":"image/webp","width":750,"height":422,"size":16.58,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d.webp"},"small":{"hash":"small_hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d","ext":".webp","mime":"image/webp","width":500,"height":281,"size":10.35,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d.webp"}},"hash":"hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d","ext":".webp","mime":"image/webp","size":18.69,"url":"/uploads/hit_by_bear_2bcd86fb9d.webp","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2020-07-16T02:31:17.908Z","updated_at":"2020-07-16T02:31:17.908Z"}]}]}}
